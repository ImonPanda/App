<p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid and served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.One of the most interesting fun facts about the Great Pyramid of Giza is that it's the oldest and last remaining of the original seven world wonders. This pyramid is also the oldest and largest of the nine at the Giza Necropolis, and is the final resting place of king Khufu.</p>
